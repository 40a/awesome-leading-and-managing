- [For an Inclusive Culture, Try Working Less](https://hackernoon.com/for-inclusive-culture-maybe-less-is-more-87b663662cea): by Rich Armstrong. Takeaway: "When our office culture is focused on business rather than socializing, we reduce the number of ways in which we all have to be the same. When we do that, we allow diversity to flourish. If your culture expects people to work long hours or hang out off-hours, the strain on the people who are different, in whatever way, is increased, and your ability to retain a diverse work force is reduced."

- [How Men & Women See the Workplace Differently](http://graphics.wsj.com/how-men-and-women-see-the-workplace-differently/): a *Wall Street Journal* article on a study conducted by LeanIn.org and MicKinsey.

- [On Being a Female Program Manager at Microsoft](https://medium.com/@lindydonna/on-being-a-female-program-manager-at-microsoft-9be6aa9243f4): by Donna Malayeri. Takeaway: The author describes how poor management can stall one's career. Chaos, lack of empathy, biased feedback ("you're too aggressive/pushy/complaining") are all factors the author faced. "...I can’t help feeling that a man would have been treated differently. Perhaps there was unconscious bias at play; perhaps I didn’t act the way women should, and this bothered people. Despite my asking for bigger opportunities, I saw project after project handed to my peers instead of me. Without opportunities to do important work, my career stalled."
