- [For an Inclusive Culture, Try Working Less](https://hackernoon.com/for-inclusive-culture-maybe-less-is-more-87b663662cea): by Rich Armstrong. Takeaway: "When our office culture is focused on business rather than socializing, we reduce the number of ways in which we all have to be the same. When we do that, we allow diversity to flourish. If your culture expects people to work long hours or hang out off-hours, the strain on the people who are different, in whatever way, is increased, and your ability to retain a diverse work force is reduced."
