## People Ops, Performance Reviews and Goal-setting

### People Operations/HR

- [From HR to People Ops: When and Why To Start a People Team](https://open.buffer.com/people-team/): by Courtney Seiter at Buffer. Covers when to start a People team, and what to consider: team size and/or growth rate, start before you need one, and your reasons. Four why's to start a team: to change the world, increase diversity, succeed, and allow your teammates to succeed.

### Career Development Conversations
TBD.

### Dev Leveling Guides—aka Engineering Ladders
It’s hard to get these right. Just b/c they work for one org doesn’t mean they’ll work for yours.

- [Open Source Culture](http://whilefalse.blogspot.com/2015/10/open-source-culture.html): by Camille Fournier. A post on Rent the Runway's engineering ladder, by the company's now-former CTO.

- [Programmer Competency Matrix](http://www.starling-software.com/employment/programmer-competency-matrix.html): by Starling Software. Great for tech skills, but would need substantial work to capture what it means to be a well-rounded dev ("client focus," "product ownership," etc). We like it for what it is ("technical only"). You'd need to add the other sections.

- [Sharing Our Engineering Ladder](http://dresscode.renttherunway.com/blog/ladder): by Camille Fournier. Rent the Runway's famous engineering ladder, in [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k4sO6pyCl_YYnf0PAXSBcX776rNcTjSOqDxZ5SDty-4/edit#gid=0) and [text/doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SxmQBrDZvj16veuc2OVO0wUX7a7vEKPM-57dNLXhuEk/edit) formats.

- [Technical Assessment Rubric](https://github.com/heddle317/onboarding/blob/master/technical_assessment_rubric.md): by Kate Heddleston. Takeaway: Different people have different trajectories. Tailor goals to target weaknesses in a category (confidence, communication, code quality, etc.).

- [Thoughts on the Technical Track](http://mcfunley.com/thoughts-on-the-technical-track): by Dan McKinley. Thoughts on how the different ways developers become technical managers, including randomly and ad hoc. "I don't think that proceeding with the assumption that leaders will just naturally emerge produces the best results."

- [Truth and Consequences of the Technical Track](http://www.elidedbranches.com/2015/11/truth-and-consequences-of-technical.html): by Camille Fournier. Takeaway: "I think the idealistic goal of management is to help teams live up to their talent potential. The realistic experience of management is often an abstraction layer between upstream and downstream, to help flow information, each layer helping to make a finer-grained set of decisions and adjustments to keep the overall company moving in the right direction."

### Goal-setting

- **How to Set Team Goals**: Notes from a Conversation with Joe Goldberg and his Colleague, David Wolpa.
  - Deciding on a goal: Why do people choose to join your org/team?; What goals has the team really rallied around in the past? Why?
  - Look at "paired metrics" from High Output Management, e.g. output + quality-measuring outcomes ($, billable hours), not inputs (utilization, "time spent on tickets")
  - People should have role in determining the goal and setting the target (which should be stretch but be realistic)
  - To what degree is achieving the goal directly under team's control?
  - Communicating a goal: Explain why goal is important to business, esp. when there's a disconnect from day-to-day. Need to do that repeatedly throughout the goal-measurement period. Naming/ritual gets people bought into it (e.g. fundraising thermometer)

- [Lightweight, Continuous Goal-Setting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XRfTZ_tmL-N-Mudu0uniIWmCOycUviXmefbSZ6ZDv1w/edit): notes by Joe Goldberg. Takeaway: Set, evaluate and adjust goals on a regular basis. This doc contains goal-setting objectives, steps, tips, and a quarterly email template.

- [A Note on Feedback](http://andrewspittle.com/2016/02/23/a-note-on-feedback/): by Andrew Spittle. Takeaway: How to use the 3-2-1-Oh performance feedback chat, "a mix of a team member writing a self-assessment and a team lead writing a review. The conversation centers around answers to these bullet points: What are 3 things you’ve done well? What are 2 areas or skills you’d like to develop? What’s one way your team lead or Automattic itself can support you? And, oh, can you write a sentence or two about how you see your career developing?"


### Performance Reviews

Performance Review Best-Practices
From a training course by Gary Ford from Uniquely HR

List of mental models and Cognitive Bias cheatsheet
“We see things not as they are but as we are.” I put these here because giving reviews is a place where bias lurks. Understand these and you’ll at least acknowledge that we’re all biased.

What to think about before giving perf reviews
You can work anywhere you’d like, I acknowledge the fact that I’m not doing you any favors
What are they exceptionally great at?
Which areas do they need to improve to be more valuable to the team/company/market?
If it wasn’t me, I know that you’d be working for a great leader
What can I do to help them grow that they wouldn’t get somewhere else?
Which books or blog posts are interesting for them (remember past talks over lunch)?
If it wasn’t in this company, I know that you’d be part of something big and meaningful.
What can the company give them to help them grow that they wouldn’t get somewhere else?

What makes someone have “impact” anyway?
I put this here since the word “impact” shows up in skill-ladders and reviews
We expect people to make impact within the scope of the level they are operating at
So we talk about impact and scope almost interchangeably
No matter what level: Good decisions → Trust → More responsibility → Impact

Scaling Culture with Feedback
Ask specific questions to see if people are living out our values
One framework for doing quarterly reviews

Review tips from KateMats

5 Phrases to use
“…that sounds important to you, let me write that down.” helps you keep your promises, and is a signal that you value what they said.
“…what can we each do by next time to make progress on this?”
“Yes and…”
“…tell me about the last time that happened.”
“…together…”
