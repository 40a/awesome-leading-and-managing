### Dev Leveling Guides—aka Engineering Ladders
It’s hard to get these right. Just b/c they work for one org doesn’t mean they’ll work for yours.

- [How to set up an Engineering Ladder
- [Open Source Culture](http://whilefalse.blogspot.com/2015/10/open-source-culture.html): by Camille Fournier. A post on Rent the Runway's ladder, by the company's now-former CTO.

- [Truth and Consequences of the Technical Track](http://www.elidedbranches.com/2015/11/truth-and-consequences-of-technical.html): by Camille Fournier. Takeaway: "I think the idealistic goal of management is to help teams live up to their talent potential. The realistic experience of management is often an abstraction layer between upstream and downstream, to help flow information, each layer helping to make a finer-grained set of decisions and adjustments to keep the overall company moving in the right direction."

Sample Assessment Rubric
Different people have different trajectories. Tailor goals to target weaknesses in a category
Confidence - not afraid to ship
Code quality
Communication
Judgement - doing things that make sense. need context.
Technical knowledge - see this rubric that’s specific to tech knowledge …
Programmer Competency Matrix
Great for tech skills, but would need substantial work to capture what it means to be a well-rounded dev ("client focus", "product ownership", etc). But I like it for what it is ("technical only"), you'd need to add the other sections

### Goal-setting
How to set team goals

3-2-1-oh

- [Lightweight, Continuous Goal-Setting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XRfTZ_tmL-N-Mudu0uniIWmCOycUviXmefbSZ6ZDv1w/edit): notes by Joe Goldberg. Takeaway: Set, evaluate and adjust goals on a regular basis. This doc contains goal-setting objectives, steps, tips, and a quarterly email template.


From a conversation with my colleague David Wolpa
Deciding on a goal
Why do people choose to join your org/team?
What goals has the team really rallied around in the past? Why? 
Look at "paired metrics" from High Output Management, e.g. output + quality
measuring outcomes ($, billable hours), not inputs (utilization, "time spent on tickets")
People should have role in determining the goal
Also in setting the target (which should be stretch but realistic)
To what degree is achieving the goal directly under team's control?
Communicating a goal
Explain why goal is important to business, esp. when there's a disconnect from day-to-day
Need to do that repeatedly throughout the goal-measurement period
Naming/ritual gets people bought into it (e.g. fundraising thermometer)


### Performance Reviews

Performance Review Best-Practices
From a training course by Gary Ford from Uniquely HR

List of mental models and Cognitive Bias cheatsheet
“We see things not as they are but as we are.” I put these here because giving reviews is a place where bias lurks. Understand these and you’ll at least acknowledge that we’re all biased.

What to think about before giving perf reviews
You can work anywhere you’d like, I acknowledge the fact that I’m not doing you any favors
What are they exceptionally great at?
Which areas do they need to improve to be more valuable to the team/company/market?
If it wasn’t me, I know that you’d be working for a great leader
What can I do to help them grow that they wouldn’t get somewhere else?
Which books or blog posts are interesting for them (remember past talks over lunch)?
If it wasn’t in this company, I know that you’d be part of something big and meaningful.
What can the company give them to help them grow that they wouldn’t get somewhere else?

What makes someone have “impact” anyway?
I put this here since the word “impact” shows up in skill-ladders and reviews
We expect people to make impact within the scope of the level they are operating at
So we talk about impact and scope almost interchangeably
No matter what level: Good decisions → Trust → More responsibility → Impact

Scaling Culture with Feedback
Ask specific questions to see if people are living out our values
One framework for doing quarterly reviews

Review tips from KateMats

5 Phrases to use
“…that sounds important to you, let me write that down.” helps you keep your promises, and is a signal that you value what they said.
“…what can we each do by next time to make progress on this?”
“Yes and…”
“…tell me about the last time that happened.”
“…together…”
