[Uniquely HR](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://uniquelyhr.com/management-development-training/&sa=D&ust=1497272863257000&usg=AFQjCNFCpE9ZQyRzTMoqItlEdU2neBygnw) by Gary Ford. Takeaway: Influence is the power to affect someone/something w/o directly forcing them. It’s about establishing credibility, finding common ground, and connecting emotionally. A systemic approach to influencing is 

### Delegation

[Why delegate?](https://medium.com/@mags/how-a-single-conversation-with-my-boss-changed-my-view-on-delegation-and-failure-ae5376451c8d#.xucavchj6) by Margaret Gould Stewart. Takeaway: 
> “If there isn’t something going off the rails on your team, then I know you’re micro-managing them. You’re good at what you do, and if you stay in the weeds on everything, you’ll keep things going perfectly, for a while. But eventually two things will happen. One, you’ll burn out. And two, you’ll eventually start to seriously piss off your team. So I better see some things going sideways, on a fairly regular basis.”

[How to handle “The Situation”](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-situation/) by Michael Lopp. Takeaway:
a) do I understand the complete context, b) am I the right person to handle it, c) do I trust my information, d) are there any inconsistencies and do I understand them e) do I understand my biases to the situation f) do I understand my emotional state relative to the issue and g) can I coherently explain multiple perspectives of it

[Identify Leaders By Giving People Assignments](http://www.feld.com/archives/2014/12/identify-leaders-giving-people-assignments.html) by Brad Feld. Takeaway:
And then, categorize the responses in one of three ways:
- 50% vanish
- 25% do the assignment
- 25% make shit happen well beyond what the assignment was. These are the leaders

[Managing for Progress & the Loss-aversion principle](http://tomtunguz.com/progress-principle) by Tom Tunguz. Takeaway: The best managers craft roles and assign projects that position their teammates to see and feel the result of their work directly. 

[How to “Get out of the way”](https://medium.com/garbage-collection/getting-out-of-the-way-cb15fa62407d#.yuuegs28h) by Phil Sarin. Takeaway: 
1. Remove mechanisms of control: examples include estimation, meetings, sprints
2. Increase focus: eliminate projects and reduce the number of priorities to 1 or 2
3. Give authority: to choose any approach that would lead to success. Need strong agreement on the goals of the project.

If your managing principle is trust and not control, then people matter more than processes do.


[“Screaming Monkey” analogy](https://hbr.org/1999/11/management-time-whos-got-the-monkey) by William Oncken, Jr. and Donald L. Wass. Takeaways:
Think of each work item as a screaming monkey. Here are questions to identify important screaming monkeys:
1. Should we even fed the monkey? 
2. Who should feed the monkey? The team or you as a leader?
3. Monkeys should be fed in-person (or by phone): monkeys sent by email belong to the recipient by default. Meet with the employee (or call) to support them.

### Delegation as “pressure”

[Do you feel pressure or do you apply pressure?](http://www.bhorowitz.com/do_you_feel_pressure_or_do_you_apply_pressure) By Ben Horowitz. Takeaways: Using “pressure” as an analogy for delegation. 

[How to put the right amount of pressure on your team](https://hbr.org/2016/07/how-to-put-the-right-amount-of-pressure-on-your-team) by Liane Davey. Takeaways: 

* There’s an ideal level of stress
* Assess the current state, and identify people who are burdened by too much stress
* You’ll know whether you need to dial the heat up, or bring it back down to a simmer
* To add more stress:
  * Increase the frequency and pointedness of coaching
  * Connect the person’s behavior to something bigger and more important
  * Allow a natural negative consequence for a lack of action
* To remove stress:
  * Provide frequent positive feedback - recognize/reinforce small victories and help problem-solve
  * Break the problem into smaller pieces - divide the project among a group of people and/or into sequential steps
  * Add structure to the problem - help your team think about how to tackle it
  * Model confidence - show ppl with your words and body language that you believe everything will work out

### Avoiding Micro- and Under- Management

Micro-management leads to distrust, lack of autonomy, demotivation.
Under-management leads to isolation, bewilderment, cluelessness.
Just-right management (“Goldilocks”) leads to increase in engagement.

#### Two Aspects of Performance: Proficiency and Commitment
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situational_leadership_theory. Takeaways:
* Proficiency depends on knowledge, ability, and aptitude
* Commitment describes motivation, interest, enthusiasm, and confidence
* Different levels of proficiency/commitment need different amounts of direction/support
* Direction: tell staff what to do, when, how. Closely monitor and provide feedback
* Support: listen, encourage (esp. on gaining independence), solicit opinions

Most people follow a pattern in learning something, as proficiency and commitment fluctuate:

1. Enthusiastic Beginner: High commitment / Low proficiency
    * Provide high direction, not much support is needed
    * Comfort zone for Conscientiousness types
2. Disillusioned Learner: Low commitment / Low proficiency
    * Provide high direction and high support (listen, empathize)
    * Comfort zone for Steadiness types
3. Reluctant Contributor: Low commitment / High proficiency
    * Not much direction is needed, but provide high support (listen, problem-solve)
    * Nobody likes this zone
4. Peak Performer: High commitment / High proficiency
    * Get out of their way, let them do their job, look for new stretch goals
    * Comfort zone for Dominant and Influence types

* Individuals are in different zones for different skills
* Ask someone where they are for a given task
  * But do your HW & be prepared to show how you disagree
