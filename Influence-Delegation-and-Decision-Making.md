## Influence, Delegation, and Decision-Making

### Delegation

[Why delegate?](https://medium.com/@mags/how-a-single-conversation-with-my-boss-changed-my-view-on-delegation-and-failure-ae5376451c8d#.xucavchj6) : “If there isn’t something going off the rails on your team, then I know you’re micro-managing them. You’re good at what you do, and if you stay in the weeds on everything, you’ll keep things going perfectly, for a while. But eventually two things will happen. One, you’ll burn out. And two, you’ll eventually start to seriously piss off your team. So I better see some things going sideways, on a fairly regular basis.”

[How to handle “The Situation”](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-situation/):
1. Am I the right person to handle this Situation? No?, who is the right Situation handler? Have I triangulated the facts? discovered multiple different perspectives? What has happened to the facts as I’ve looked at them through different lenses? What has this triangulation told me about my sources of information?
2. Do I have complete context? all the essential facts, opinions, and lies? Have all relevant, affected, and interested parties who care about the Situation weighed in?
3. What is the track record of my sources of information? Do I trust the sources of information? If I have a track record with these humans, how does that color the information they provided? Do I understand the nature of the biases of those providing the information? Am I clear what they have to lose or gain by sharing this information? Do they volunteer these losses or gains as part of my discovery?
4. What inconsistencies in facts have been discovered and do I understand the nature of those inconsistencies? I’m not looking for resolution for inconsistencies, just the nature. He and she disagree on principle. He didn’t have all the essential facts so it kind’a looks like he’s lying.
5. Do I understand my biases relative to the Situation? If my role in this Situation is to make a decision, part of understanding involves understanding my bias. With this understanding of bias in hand, am I still the right person to make an informed call here?
6. Do I understand my emotional state relative to the issue at hand? A sure-fire way to bias my judgment is emotion. Like bias, it is nigh impossible to separate my emotions from an issue, whether those emotions are positive, negative, or a bit of both. Am I clear how emotion is affecting me relative to this decision? If it’s affecting me negatively, will cool-down time help? No, ok, who is a better neutral party who can make a decision here?
7. Can I coherently explain multiple perspectives of the Situation? What happens when I explain one perspective of the Situation to a neutral party? How about when I explain the competing perspective? If I can effectively explain the Situation and its complexity from both perspectives and with a distinct lack of emotion, I’m close.

[Identify Leaders By Giving People Assignments](http://www.feld.com/archives/2014/12/identify-leaders-giving-people-assignments.html) : Then, categorize the responses in one of three ways:
- 50% vanish
- 25% do the assignment
- 25% make shit happen well beyond what the assignment was. These are the leaders

[Managing for Progress & the Loss-aversion principle](http://tomtunguz.com/progress-principle) : The best managers craft roles and assign projects that position their teammates to see and feel the result of their work directly. Without this direct or near-direct feedback, it’s easy to feel like we’re all cogs in a machine, and the work we complete disappears into the ether. Even if these are small wins, these tasks create a sense of momentum, progress and fulfillment.

Loss aversion shows losing $100 decreases happiness more than a $100 gift increases happiness. Similarly, a setback at work diminishes employee happiness more than twice as much as a win increases it. To feel great at work, the authors argue employees need twice as many wins as losses, even if those wins are very small.

[How to “Get out of the way”](https://medium.com/garbage-collection/getting-out-of-the-way-cb15fa62407d#.yuuegs28h) : 
Leaders are told to “get out of the way” so their reports can grow and do their best work. How, specifically, do you do that?
1. Remove mechanisms of control: examples include estimation, meetings, sprints
2. Increase focus: eliminate projects and reduce the number of priorities to 1 or 2
3. Give authority: to choose any approach that would lead to success. Need strong agreement on the goals of the project.

If your managing principle is trust and not control, then people matter more than processes do.


[“Screaming Monkey” analogy](https://hbr.org/1999/11/management-time-whos-got-the-monkey) : 

Think of each work item as a screaming monkey. It’ll scream until it’s fed (i.e. the work is done). A coworker comes to you with a screaming monkey on their shoulder…
1. Decide whether the monkey should even be fed: maybe the work isn’t worth the time/energy required to do it right? 
2. Decide who the monkey belongs to: Should you keep the work on your employee’s plate, supporting them in learning how to feed it? Or is this something that only you (with your specific role) should take on?
3. Monkeys should be fed in-person (or by phone): monkeys sent by email belong to the recipient by default. Meet with the employee (or call) to support them.

#### Levels of initiative
0. Wait until told
1. Inform manager of issue, ask what to do
2. Recommend researched course of action, take agreed upon action
3. Act on own, but alert manager at once
4. Act on own, then routinely report
5. Act on own, don’t bother to report

* For 0 - 2, manager makes decision, 3 - 5 are employee’s decision
* Not realistic/ideal to have everyone in 5 for every task
* To figure out which person/task combo goes where, see [Task-relevant maturity](https://getlighthouse.com/blog/management-concept/)

### Delegation as “pressure”

[Do you feel pressure or do you apply pressure?](http://www.bhorowitz.com/do_you_feel_pressure_or_do_you_apply_pressure) : Using “pressure” as an analogy for delegation. By Ben Horowitz.

[How to put the right amount of pressure on your team](https://hbr.org/2016/07/how-to-put-the-right-amount-of-pressure-on-your-team) : 


* There’s an ideal level of stress
* Assess the current state, and identify people who are burdened by too much stress
* You’ll know whether you need to dial the heat up, or bring it back down to a simmer
* To add more stress:
  * Increase the frequency and pointedness of coaching
  * Connect the person’s behavior to something bigger and more important
  * Allow a natural negative consequence for a lack of action
* To remove stress:
  * Provide frequent positive feedback - recognize/reinforce small victories and help problem-solve
  * Break the problem into smaller pieces - divide the project among a group of people and/or into sequential steps
  * Add structure to the problem - help your team think about how to tackle it
  * Model confidence - show ppl with your words and body language that you believe everything will work out

### Avoiding Micro- and Under- Management

Micro-management leads to distrust, lack of autonomy, demotivation.
Under-management leads to isolation, bewilderment, cluelessness.
Just-right management (“Goldilocks”) leads to increase in engagement.

#### Two Aspects of Performance: Proficiency and Commitment
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situational_leadership_theory
* Proficiency depends on knowledge, ability, and aptitude
* Commitment describes motivation, interest, enthusiasm, and confidence
* Different levels of proficiency/commitment need different amounts of direction/support
* Direction: tell staff what to do, when, how. Closely monitor and provide feedback
* Support: listen, encourage (esp. on gaining independence), solicit opinions

Most people follow a pattern in learning something, as proficiency and commitment fluctuate:

1. Enthusiastic Beginner: High commitment / Low proficiency
    * Provide high direction, not much support is needed
    * Comfort zone for Conscientiousness types
2. Disillusioned Learner: Low commitment / Low proficiency
    * Provide high direction and high support (listen, empathize)
    * Comfort zone for Steadiness types
3. Reluctant Contributor: Low commitment / High proficiency
    * Not much direction is needed, but provide high support (listen, problem-solve)
    * Nobody likes this zone
4. Peak Performer: High commitment / High proficiency
    * Get out of their way, let them do their job, look for new stretch goals
    * Comfort zone for Dominant and Influence types

* Individuals are in different zones for different skills
* Ask someone where they are for a given task
  * But do your HW & be prepared to show how you disagree

### Decision-Making
Content from [uniquelyHR](http://uniquelyhr.com/)

#### Levels of Involvement, and when they should be used
* Low (unilateral decisions, staff may be informed about process after decision made)
  * Decision was already made
  * Tight deadline or emergency situation
* Medium (leadership consults with subset of organization)
  * Views of colleagues can contribute useful options
  * Morale will be significantly affected
* High (majority of team involved in discussion, consensus determines final outcome)
  * Best decision requires input/involvement of team
  * No mutual purpose among stakeholders
  * Commitment is of vital importance to success of plan

#### Decision-Making Tools, and when they should be used

* Impact Changeability Table: when you want to choose from several actions with varying degrees of impact and effort
  * Create 2x2 matrix of “difficulty” and “impact”
  * Place options on matrix, choose best tradeoff of difficulty and impact
* Criteria Screen: when you want to decide between several options using specific criteria
  * List criteria as rows and options as columns
  * Score each criteria-option pair, choose the option with the “best” score
* Force Field Analysis: when you want to test the viability of an approach using weighted criteria
  * Have one page for each option
  * List pros on one side of a page, cons on the other
  * Use weighted arrows to visually illustrate the strength of each pro/con
* Cards on the Table: gives everyone a voice, assess commitment, stops one member from dominating the discussion
  * For each option, give each person 3 minutes to share his/her opinion
  * No interruption from other group members. Clarifying questions only.
  * Facilitator notes key points from each person on shared doc, summarizes all

### Decision-Making Best-Practices

#### Before
* Explicitly outline your decision-making process in advance and communicate it

#### During
* Weigh in on both dissent and agreement
* Label “soft” vs “hard” opinions
* In monthly all-hands meetings, communicate open decisions, the process being used for each, and who’s accountable for each
* Acknowledge risk of moving forward (or not)
* Ask “Are we at a decision point?”
* Set a timeline for discussion before decision is made

#### After
* Document how decisions were made and share w/ those not involved
* Share priority, rationale, and expected benefits when communicating a decision
* Be explicit about decisions that have been made
