- [Empathy - The Hidden Ingredient of Good Software Development (video)](http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/86154111): by Daniel Bryant. Takeaway: "When gathering requirements and performing business analysis, it is obvious that the ability to experience from within another user/customer/being's frame of reference is a valuable skill, but the same can be said when writing code. If we follow Martin Fowler’s train of thought where “any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand” we can see that empathy is at the heart of this skill."

- [The Future of Programming (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecIWPzGEbFc): by Uncle Bob Martin. Takeaway: A history of software development, with context on how developers have solved problems in the industry and where the profession's going.

- [Speed in Software Development](https://www.targetprocess.com/articles/speed-in-software-development/): by Michael Dubakov. Takeaway: "Software development pace / productivity / speed is a complex, interdependent and multifaceted concept. It has no easy solution. You can’t shout at people “work faster!” You can’t blindly cut corners and focus on value added activities only. The only solution is to think deeply about the company, development processes, people, tools, etc. Build a model and think."

- [What Can Developers Learn from Being on Call?](https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/06/18/operate-your-software/?imm_mid=0f4059&cmp=em-webops-na-na-newsltr_20170630): by Julia Evans. Takeaway: Based on a Twitter thread begun by Charity Majors, this post suggests that being on call helps you to learn what kinds of production problems are common and uncommon; understand what needs urgent attention; design reliable systems; build in monitoring and diagnostics early; understand the parts of the system that aren’t yours; gain confidence in your judgement; make minimum effective change; learn about distributed systems and consistency and race conditions, and become a better developer.

### Teamwork

[9 Attributes of Successful Development Teams](https://about.gitlab.com/2017/05/23/attributes-of-successful-development-teams/): by Rebecca Dodd at GitLab. Takeaway: Great teams automate everything, are meticulous about documentation, use collaboration tools and integrated platforms, version control everything, make it easy for everyone to contribute, spend time on side projects, make code review collaborative, and are allowed to be creative.

### Technical Debt/Managing It

- [A Crystal Ball to Prioritise Technical Debt in Monoliths or Microservices: Adam Tornhill's Thoughts](https://www.infoq.com/news/2017/04/tornhill-prioritise-tech-debt): by Daniel Bryant. Takeaway: a summary of Thornhill's QCon London 2017 talk, which covered "methods to identify 'hotspots' of code complexity and churn; the benefit of continually evaluating the suitability of the architecture for the current system, for example, by examining 'temporal coupling' of components or microservices; and that the cost of inter-team coordination can often be learned from examining the social metadata associated with code commits within a version control system."

- [A Seamless Way to Keep Track of Technical Debt in Your Source Code](http://philippe.bourgau.net/a-seamless-way-to-keep-track-of-technical-debt-in-your-source-code/): by Philippe Bourgau. Takeaway: use TODO comments as a good starting point for tracking technical debt.
