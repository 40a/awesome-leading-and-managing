## Onboarding 

### Onboarding Philosophies and Planning

- [How We Onboard New Employees Differently at Bizzabo](http://geeks.bizzabo.com/post/128481928604/how-we-onboard-new-employees-differently-at): by Bizzabo. Takeaway: No deployments to production on your first day, but instead identify tools to make an impact. Most onboarding tasks are done solo, but "distracting" team members is okay. Also: All software/devstack setup is manual, so that people will know how to fix it when it breaks; and new hires are encouraged to give constructive feedback about the product.

- [The New Grad Rotation Program: Optimizing Team Fit And Enhancing Collaboration](https://engineering.mongodb.com/post/the-new-grad-rotation-program-optimizing-team-fit-and-enhancing-collaboration/): by Judah Schvimver. Takeaway: why MongoDB starts new hires on a "rotation" through multiple teams, and how this enables them and the org to find the best fit and increase empathy.

- [Onboarding Plan](https://github.com/heddle317/onboarding/blob/master/onboarding_plan.md) by Kate Heddleston. A four-week plan with exercises and more info. 

- [Technical Onboarding, Training, and Mentoring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg4jRSH7EE) (video): a full onboarding curriculum by Kate Heddleston, from RailsConf 2014. Takeaway: Onboarding is taking someone from outside the team and making them productive (technical knowledge); independent/autonomous (company/process knowledge); reliably independent; and confident/believe they are valuable (personal development).
