## Onboarding

### [My favorite Onboarding deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bQt-9ROFBxtQ9njEyq-HrbdDQDy2BwZ6rpU0yiiO--4/edit#slide=id.p)
By Roy Rappaport of Netflix. After reading it you feel as if you know him personally and understand what it’ll be like to work with him.

### [A full Onboarding curriculum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg4jRSH7EE)

Onboarding is taking someone from outside the team and making them a...
- *productive (efficient)* - technical knowledge
- *independent (autonomous)* - company/process knowledge
  * "_reliable independence_" = fully onboarded
- *confident (believe they are valuable)* - personal development
...member of the team, in the most efficient way possible.

#### Why onboard?

- For Individual: addresses attrition
- For Company: addresses how adding heads decreases productivity
- For Team: pays down "team debt", forces you to understand process/tech so you can explain it to others. Keeps people on the same page.
  * Teamwork is multiplier on sum of team’s talent
- For Diversity: addresses over-reliance on [homophily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophily) to acquire knowledge and bond

#### Who can onboard?

- Anyone
- But sophomore engineers are best (have relevant experience, were new recently)

#### How? (4 week plan)

- Like bumper-bowling: have complete autonomy but in a safe constrained environment
- Set boundaries for them, then slowly move them out over time
- Onboarding categories
  * Tech knowledge - most straightforward
  * Company/process knowledge - sometimes it’s not written down
  * Personal development - career trajectories

##### Week 1 - Setup and shipping code

Touch base with them daily, at least.  If you don’t hear from them, check in.

* Dev environment setup
  * from last person who joined team
  * Have time goal (e.g. “1 day”)
  * New dev updates docs
  * Get them the right books/material to get them started learning

* Shipping code
  * Ship small/early
  * Give them very small task to ship - add themselves to superusers config file
  * Introduce a project for them to start. Must be…
    * small, well scoped
    * not time-sensitive for product
    * not too technically complex
    * gives them an opportunity to start learning company code style
