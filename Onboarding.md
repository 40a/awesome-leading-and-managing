## Onboarding

### [My favorite Onboarding deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bQt-9ROFBxtQ9njEyq-HrbdDQDy2BwZ6rpU0yiiO--4/edit#slide=id.p)
By Roy Rappaport of Netflix. After reading it you feel as if you know him personally and understand what it’ll be like to work with him.

### [A full Onboarding curriculum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg4jRSH7EE)

Onboarding is taking someone from outside the team and making them a...
- *productive (efficient)* - technical knowledge
- *independent (autonomous)* - company/process knowledge
  * "_reliable independence_" = fully onboarded
- *confident (believe they are valuable)* - personal development
...member of the team, in the most efficient way possible.

#### Why onboard?

- For Individual: addresses attrition
- For Company: addresses how adding heads decreases productivity
- For Team: pays down "team debt", forces you to understand process/tech so you can explain it to others. Keeps people on the same page.
  * Teamwork is multiplier on sum of team’s talent
- For Diversity: addresses over-reliance on [homophily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophily) to acquire knowledge and bond

#### Who can onboard?

- Anyone
- But sophomore engineers are best (have relevant experience, were new recently)

#### How? (4 week plan)

- Like bumper-bowling: have complete autonomy but in a safe constrained environment
- Set boundaries for them, then slowly move them out over time
- Onboarding categories
  * Tech knowledge - most straightforward
  * Company/process knowledge - sometimes it’s not written down
  * Personal development - career trajectories

##### Week 1 - Setup and shipping code

Touch base with them daily, at least.  If you don’t hear from them, check in.

* Dev environment setup
  * from last person who joined team
  * Have time goal (e.g. “1 day”)
  * New dev updates docs
  * Get them the right books/material to get them started learning

* Shipping code
  * Ship small/early
  * Give them very small task to ship - add themselves to superusers config file
  * Introduce a project for them to start. Must be…
    * small, well scoped
    * not time-sensitive for product
    * not too technically complex
    * gives them an opportunity to start learning company code style

* Journaling/note-taking
  * Most will already do this, but put structure around it
  * 3 things per day or week that they didn’t understand
  * three new things they’ve learned, etc.
  * Take a look at it together, or have them email it to you

* Social event
  * Puts names to faces
  * Makes new person more comfortable

##### Week 2 - Context of company & shadowing

Get them to update inaccurate/confusing docs. Introduce the idea that they’re not going to be useful for a while, that they’re just going to learn as much as they can.

* History of company
  * Founders. Why’d they start company
  * Early hires
  * Team philosophies
* Team map
  * Org chart + seating chart
  * What each team/person works on
  * Managers, team leads, etc.
* Code labs 2x/week, 1hr
  * Like public office-hours
  * Safe environment for jr devs to ask questions to sr devs, OK to not know
  * Prepare some topics but leave most time for jr devs’ Q&A
* Shadowing
  * Pair with sr dev who will talk out loud and explain as they go
  * Hour, day, week
  * Make sure jr engineer isn’t picking up bad habits (but be forgiving)

##### Week 3 - Communication

* 1:1s
  * Start pulling back. 1:1s should be weekly at this point
  * Feedback on what they could improve for next time, and what they’ve done well
  * Ask what they learned this week, and what they should learn next week
* Goal setting
  * Short & long term
* Feedback
  * Early and often
  * Remember how to give feedback to beginners (tell them what you want them to do)
* Presentations
  * One topic per month
  * 5 minute presentation to rest of team
  * Something they should research independently, that will be useful to them in the long run

##### Week 4 - Continue pulling back

* Review concepts
  * Have them explain to you something they learned in past month, in 5 minutes
* Check-in regularly
  * "How’s it going? How are you feeling about everything? Anything you need a hand with?"
  * Set expectations
    * _e.g. “research for 1 hour before asking for help”_
* Elective shadowing
  * Taper frequency
  * Let them choose who/when
* Co-piloting larger project
  * Like drivers-ed (instructor has steering-wheel & brake)

##### Week 5 & Beyond

* Check-in on goals - what are the roadblocks to meeting their goals?
* Tailor projects, code-labs, etc. to their progress
* Informal apprenticeship
  * Based on what they want to learn long-term

### [A different approach to Onboarding](http://geeks.bizzabo.com/post/128481928604/how-we-onboard-new-employees-differently-at)

* No deployments to production on your first day. Instead, day-1 goal is "Acquire the tools needed to be impactful in our company".
* Most onboarding tasks are done solo, but "distracting" team members is allowed
* All software/devstack setup is manual, so people will know how to fix it when it breaks
* New hires are encouraged to give constructive feedback about the product

### Onboarding Rotation

At MogoDb they [start new-hires on a "rotation" through multiple teams](https://engineering.mongodb.com/post/the-new-grad-rotation-program-optimizing-team-fit-and-enhancing-collaboration/), to find the best team-fit and increase empathy for other teams.
