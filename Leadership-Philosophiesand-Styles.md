## Leadership Philosophies and Styles

This topic comes first, because the following articles offer great frameworks/definitions for leadership.

- [A Model for Leadership](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/leadership-comes-from-everywhere/): A political article, but it provides one the most complete leadership frameworks we’ve seen. Values are the linchpin in the model, but important things precede and flow from values:
  - Experience: the total knowledge extracted from yr life i.e. understanding, wisdom, etc.
  - Judgement: ability to make considered decisions or come to sensible conclusions.
  - Values: your principles or standards of behavior. What you believe is important in life. 
  - Vision: ability to articulate an ambitious and seemingly unattainable goal.
  - Strategy: ability to explain the steps necessary to achieve that vision.
  - Tactics: decompose a strategy into a series of logical actions that will achieve each step

- [Failure as a Service](https://medium.com/servant-leadership/failure-as-a-service-937473b0c9b8): What it means to be a leader, by Rich Armstrong. Takeaways: 
  - Servant-leaders shouldn’t make decisions that should be made by the folks closest to the problem), unless they can’t be answered with readily-available or easily-collected data, and there’s no consensus on the solution.
  - "When the people you manage bring you a tough call, and you choose right, they get the credit. When you choose wrong, you get the blame. And it’s OK, pookie. That’s what you’re here for."

- [Lazy Leadership: thinking of your org as a machine](https://medium.com/flow/lazy-leadership-8ba19e34f959#.mixfpu15t): by Andrew Wilkinson. Takeaway: "It’s about spending time on what matters and what you’re good at, then leaving everything else to your team. Giving up on the idea that you have to drive yourself into the ground in order to run a successful company, and thinking about your business as a machine that you design and optimize, instead of becoming a worn out cog within."

- [Leadership FAQ](https://medium.com/eshares-blog/a-managers-faq-35858a229f84#.e0uby6of3): Essay by Henry Ward that offers a concise list of essential questions with clear, thought-provoking answers. For example: "How do I give negative feedback? *By being curious.*."

- [Simon Sinek: Leaders Eat Last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReRcHdeUG9Y) (video): Takeaways: 
- Humans survived due (in part) to four brain chemicals. Two you can get solo: endorphins, which mask pain (e.g. runner’s high) and allow us to hunt food over long distances; and dopamine, the pleasure derived from getting something done (very addictive). 
- Two others require social interaction to manifest:
  - Serotonin, the “relationship chemical." Feeling of public pride, produces confidence (e.g. graduation ceremony), “win one for the coach”, “make our parents proud." 
    - Can be tricked: display of wealth = higher status. But there was no strengthening of a relationship, so it is unfulfilling.
    - Keeps social order (we evolved to favor strong relationships so all members of tribes would trust each other. Not just survival of the fittest). 
    - We constantly judge/assess who’s Alpha (they get to eat/mate first). This is why we try to raise our own status, so we can eat/mate first.
    - Leadership/Alpha comes at a cost. Leads to running towards danger (and putting ourselves at risk) to protect group.
  - Oxytocin - love/trust/friendship. Safety. Someone’s got my back. Get it from physical contact. Why shaking hands is important. Both parties get oxytocin. Even witnesses get it.
    - Also get this from time/energy generosity (money won’t work). Leaders give time/energy.
    - Must be a sacrifice (that’s why email doesn’t work for emotion/judgement/evaluation).
    - Oxytocin has many benefits: boosts immune system and inhibits addition
    - Takes time to build up (that’s why people usually don’t get married after first date).
- One more chemical: cortisol (stress, anxiety). Fight/flight. Paranoid. Stiffens muscles, raises heart-rate. It’s communicable in social groups. Extra energy to heighten our awareness, comes from other systems: growth, immune system.
Unsafe environments cause constant drips of cortisol and suppresses Oxytocin.
- External dangers are constant (e.g. competition), but internal dangers (inside the company) are variable, and determined by leaders. When tribes feel safe, they can work together to face external dangers.
- Leaders decide who gets in the circle of safety/belonging and who stays out; how big the circle should be (e.g. everyone, or just “inner circle” of top execs).
- Leaders make sure those under them feel safe (in the circle), so they make those under them feel safe, so they make customers feel safe.
- Leadership isn’t a position, it’s a choice to protect and sacrifice for those around you.
  - The shield is more important than the spear to the phalanx.
  - Give to others, and they will give to others in turn.
